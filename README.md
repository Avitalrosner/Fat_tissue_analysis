# Project Proposal:

Background:
Although human beings seem very different from the outside, when it comes to our biological info, aka DNA - we are very similar to each other, and mostly we express the same genes respectivally to each cell type.
With that being said, external factor like our life-style, the food we eat and such, can have an impact of the expression levels of some gene. 
There is a cool noninvasive method called cfRNA, with which we can research the RNA content in the blood.
The processed in simple terms goes like this:

Cells die due to Apoptosis / necrosis, or cells secrete RNA content via extra-cellular vesicle. Either way, RNA gets in the blood stream, and blood sample can be harvest, processed, and RNA material is being sent to sequencing.

Project goal:
This project is a part of a bigger project that looks for differences in the gene expression found in human blood samples.
Spesifically here, I've created an analysis based on the [GTEx database](https://gtexportal.org/home/)
The database contains information of RNA seq that was harvest from biopsies of most tissues in the body.
Here I'm interested in calculating the marker genes the fat tissues - both Adipose Subcutaneous and Adipose Visceral, in the aim of checking the markers I find in the RNA seq data I'll receive from our patients blood sample.
This way, I might be able to find interesting phenomenas in regaurds to fat tissues - perhaps the fat marker genes are more represented in people with obisity, or less represented in those who suffer from anorexia.
