# Project Proposal

### Background:

Although human beings seem very different from the outside, when it comes to our biological info, aka DNA - we are very similar to each other, and mostly we express the same genes respectivally to each cell type.
With that being said, external factor like our life-style, the food we eat and such, can have an impact of the expression levels of some genes. 

There is a cool noninvasive method called cfRNA, with which we can research the RNA content in the blood.
Meaning that after analysing the results of the RNA seq, we might be able to find interesting differences between blood samples of different patients.

The processed in simple terms goes like this:

1. Cells die due to Apoptosis / necrosis and spill their content to the blood.
2. Another option - cells secrete RNA via extra-cellular vesicle.
3. Either way - there are RNA molecules circulating freely in the blood stream.
4. Blood sample can be harvest, processed, and RNA material is sent to sequencing.

### Project goal:

This project is a part of a bigger project that looks for differences in the gene expression of human blood samples, that are processed using the cfRNA method.

Spesifically here, I want to create an analysis based on the [GTEx database](https://gtexportal.org/home/) -that contains information of RNA seq data. The RNA was harvest from biopsies of most tissues in the body.
Here I'm interested in finding the marker genes of the fat tissues - both Adipose Subcutaneous and Adipose Visceral.

The markers I find will be used for analysing the RNA seq data that would be received from our patients blood sample that went through the cfRNA processing.

This way, I might be able to find interesting phenomenas in regaurds to fat tissues - perhaps the fat marker genes are more represented in people with obisity, or less represented in those who suffer from anorexia.
